        <p>
          Mina Arena is a (truly) free-to-play, multiplayer blockchain game where you control your
          team in the arena in turn-based combat against an opponent.
        </p>
        <img alt="Screenshot of the game board" src="./images/how_to_play/intro_arena.png" class="mx-auto my-[50px]"/>
        <p>Mina Arena is inspired by tabletop games like Warhammer and Axis and Allies.</p>
        <p>
          The instructions on this page will guide you through getting started and playing your
          first game.

        <h2 class="font-almendra-bold text-3xl">Authentication</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of using usernames and passwords to log in, Mina Arena uses public-private
          keypairs. For now, we have not integrated with any mobile wallets like Brave or Auro.
          Instead, we save the keypair in your local browser storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you can play, you will need to configure your credentials via the User Management
          page, as shown below.

        <p>
          Once you set your Mina public key, you are ready to move on to drafting units and

          Warning: If you start playing Mina Arena and later go back to the user management tool

        <h2 class="font-almendra-bold text-3xl">Drafting Units</h2>
        <p>
          When you start your first game, you will be taken to the squad selection page, where you
          will select which units you will bring to the battle.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center italic">The squad selection page.</p>
        <p>
          Mina Arena features a number of different types of units you can use in a battle, but
          each unit you use in the game will be unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Drafting" a unit means creating a new copy of that unit, with a custom name, which is
          specific to you and different from any other copies of that unit you or anyone else has
          created already. For example, you can create multiple copies of the Swordsman unit, each
          with individual names and game histories.

        <p class="text-center italic">
          Example of a Ballista making a ranged attack at a Swordsman.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the above example, a Ballista unit makes a ranged attack against an enemy Swordsman.
          Let's analyze what happened to better understand unit stats:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-4 [&>*]:mt-8">
          <li>
            The Ballista makes 2 ranged attacks as shown on its <i
              class="fa fa-solid fa-hashtag"
          /> <b>Number of Attacks</b> stat for its ranged attack profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each attack the Ballista makes, it must first make a hit roll. Each hit roll
            will succeed on a roll of 3+, as indicated by the Ballista's <i
              class="fa fa-solid fa-bullseye-arrow"
          /> <b>Hit Roll</b> stat.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each successful hit roll, it must then make a wound roll. Each wound roll will
            succeed on a roll of 2+, as indicated by the Ballista's <i
              class="fa fa-solid fa-hand-fist"
          /> <b>Wound Roll</b> stat.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each successful wound roll, the target unit must make an armor save roll.
            Because the Swordsman has an <i class="fa fa-solid fa-shield"/> <b>Armor Save</b>
            stat of 4+, it would normally block incoming damage on a roll of 4+, but in this case,
            because the Ballista's ranged attack has an <i class="fa fa-solid fa-shield-slash"/>
            <b>Armor Piercing</b> value of 2, the Swordsman's armor save roll is worsened by 2, meaning
            he needs to roll a 6 in order to block the damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each failed armor save roll, the target unit would suffer 2 damage as indicated
            by the Ballista's <i class="fa fa-solid fa-heart-crack"/> <b>Damage</b> stat.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="font-almendra-bold text-3xl">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>In Mina Arena, players alternate taking turns commanding their armies.</p>
        <p>
          Each player's turn consists of a series of phases: the Movement phase, the Shooting
          phase, and the Melee phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          In every phase, the acting player may activate as many units as they wish, as long as
          those units are eligible to act within the current phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Movement phase, units can be moved around the board up to some max distance based
          on their <i class="fa fa-solid fa-person-running-fast"/> <b>Movement Speed</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Shooting phase, units which are equipped with <i class="fa fa-solid fa-bow-arrow"/>
          <b>Ranged Weapons</b> can be ordered to make ranged attacks against enemy units within
          a certain distance based on their weapon's max range.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Melee phase, units can be ordered to make melee attacks against enemy units
          within melee range.
        </p>

        <p>Below are some screenshots from an example game, showing some of these concepts:</p>
